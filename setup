Additionally, I increased the fast scroll sensitivity, which allows me to navigate through the code faster when using the Alt key with the scroll wheel.

Furthermore, I find sticky scrolling particularly useful, especially when working with long files. It helps me maintain a sense of location and easily track my position, similar to how breadcrumbs work in navigation.
