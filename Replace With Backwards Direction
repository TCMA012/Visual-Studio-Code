How to Replace All With Backwards Direction?

e.g.
Text:

```
Reactive Patterns with RxJS.
A practical guide.
```

Cursor is at the beginning of line 2.
i.e. just before the character "A".
Replace All " " With "_" Backwards Direction.

Text becomes:

```
Reactive_Patterns_with_RxJS.
A practical guide.
```



This is ok.
Is there another way?
e.g. 
Notepad++ has a “Backwards direction” checkbox which can be checked.
